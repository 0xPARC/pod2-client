[patch."https://github.com/0xPARC/pod2"]
# Path to the local pod2 repository.
# This path is relative to the repository root directory.
# If your 'pod2' and 'client-pod2' folders are siblings, this path will work:
pod2 = { path = "../pod2" }

# Alternatively, you can use an absolute path:
# pod2 = { path = "/path/to/your/local/pod2" }
