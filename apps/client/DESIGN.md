# App design

The Pod2 client app will have the following features:

- Allow users to manage their private keys
- Allow users to import, export, sign, and delete PODs
- Receive (via custom URL handlers) POD requests, allowing the user to process the request
- Allow users to share their public key
- Allow users to send signed messages to other users via a public key lookup mechanism
- Allow users to make POD requests to each other

These are eventual aspirational goals. Development will be incremental, pursuing minimal versions of certain features step-by-step.
